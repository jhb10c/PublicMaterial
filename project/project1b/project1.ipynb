Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",

To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section, we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`. Do not reassign the variable name `latest` to anything else in your notebook, otherwise there is the chance that our tests grade against what `latest` was reassigned to.\n",

The link has been attributed to family planning: if parents can expect that their children will all survive into adulthood, then they will choose to have fewer children. We can see if this association is evident in Bangladesh by plotting the relationship between total fertility rate and [child mortality rate per 1000 children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_mortality)."
